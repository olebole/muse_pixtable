This is a python representation of a MUSE "pixtable". In MUSE,
pixtables are FITS tables (or image lists), where each row represents
a bin with specified x,y position on sky, wavelength, flux, flux
error, data quality flag.

It is possible to limit the wavelength range or select individual IFUs
and/or slices.
